Use the left mouse click when hovering over a command block to add the command to the command list. Once you have selected the commands that you wish, press the start button to start execution of the commands

Note that when running rotations scripts, if the character is too close to the edge, it may fall off the edge. In the event of this happening, press the stop button and the character will return to the starting position.
